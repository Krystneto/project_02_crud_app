My approach for this project was to create a simple template for myself
to create a card database for my card game called Burst. My homepage will
display a gallery of the entire database. I will be able to create, update
and delete each card from the database.

Some unsolved issues that I came across was have the database not update
properly if the "name" category is string with more than one word.
Unfornately I was not able to demostrated proper use of a template for
client side rendering. I am serving all templates through the server side
code. I have not been able to fully comprehend how to use handlebars.js
properly on the client side.
