###Burst Trading Card Generator

This a card generator app for a trading card game that I created in a
one week sprint. This is app will create and store the cards into a database. Along with 
creating a card there are options to update or delete specific cards.

###Technologies Planned for use

HTML5, CSS3 with BootStrap, Javascript, JQuery, Node.js, AJAX.
Middleware: Express, Express-Handlebars, Body-parser, Serve-favicon
Morgan.
Database: MongoDB and Heroku

###Approach

My approach for this project was to create a simple template for myself
to create a card database for my card game called Burst. My homepage will
display a gallery of the entire database. I will be able to create, update
and delete each card from the database.

Some unsolved issues that I came across was have the database not update
properly if the "name" category is string with more than one word.
Unfornately I was not able to demostrated proper use of a template for
client side rendering. I am serving all templates through the server side
code. I have not been able to fully comprehend how to use handlebars.js
properly on the client side.
